# Book Review Application

The Book Review Application is a web-based platform that allows users to create accounts, add, delete, and update book reviews. It enables users to see the ratings and reviews provided by other users. The platform calculates and displays the average rating of a book when multiple users review it.

## Features

- **User Account Management**: Create an account to interact with the platform.
- **Book Review Management**: Add, delete, and update reviews for books.
- **Rating System**: Calculates the average rating for a book when multiple users provide ratings.
- **Unified Book Identification**: Books are uniquely identified by their name and author. If two users review the same book, their ratings contribute to a single average rating.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: ReactJS with Material-UI (MUI) for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot for robust and scalable server-side logic.
- **Database**: Integration with a database to store user data, reviews, and book ratings.
